    This Agreement is effective as of the date hereof and shall continue in
    effect for a period of thirty (30) days from the date hereof.
    Thereafter it will automatically renew for consecutive thirty (30) day
    periods unless earlier cancelled as follows.

    This Agreement may be cancelled, with or without cause, by either party
    at any time by written notice to the other. However, the Contractor may
    not terminate this Agreement until Contractor has completed any
    unfinished trip Contractor has undertaken at the time, unless
    authorized to do so by Carrier.

    Upon termination of this Agreement, final settlement will occur within
    forty-five (45) days after Contractor fulfills Contractor's obligations
    as set forth in subparagraph 2(d) above. It is understood, however,
    that until the requirements of subparagraph 2(d) are fulfilled, final
    settlement will be withheld, and the forty-five (45) day payment
    provision will not apply.

    The parties have executed two copies of this agreement effective as of
    the date first above written. Carrier shall retain the original of this
    Agreement. One copy shall remain with the vehicle during the period of
    this Agreement, and the other copy shall be retained by Contractor.
    When this Agreement covers more than one vehicle, the copies remaining
    with the vehicle may be photocopies if the original.

    Contractor represents and warrants that Contractor has read this
    Agreement in full, is familiar with its terms and provisions, that no
    representations have been made either to or by Carrier, either directly
    or indirectly, that are not incorporated herein.
