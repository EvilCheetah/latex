# Description
This branch contains examples that demonstrate the compilation issue when using
`datatool` in combination with `tabularray`.

# Structure
- [`datatool-tabularray`](./datatool-tabularray/) - an attempt to create a document that automatically loads data into a `tabularray` table using `datatool`, which is currently unsuccessful.
- [`datatool-tabularray`](./datatool-tabularx/) - an example project demonstrating the intended outcome, where `datatool`  is successfully used in combination with `tabularx`.

# Current Solution
The only solution that I was able to find: [`Stack Overflow - How to use DTLforeach (datatool) within a tabularray table?`](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/638066)
