Transaction and any applicable fees. Company may not, at any time, make a
Transaction that will exceed the prepaid balance.&nbsp; If Company does, Company is
fully liable to Issuer for the amount of the Transaction and any applicable
fees.&nbsp; If Issuer permits or has previously permitted Company to exceed its

funding entity (including Program Operator) in connection with resolving any
errors or overpayments and (ii) if applicable, to accept instructions from the
Company to add or deduct funds from the prepaid Account and, in the case of
deductions, to return those funds to the Company. Issuer may, upon Program
Operator’s request, return to Program Operator any funds advanced on Company’s
behalf by Program Operator, provided such funds have been maintained by Issuer
in a segregated Account balance and not comingled with funds deposited by
Company. In the event of any dispute arising in connection with any such
returned funds, Company agrees to look solely to Program Operator for resolving
such dispute. </span></p>

specifically in the event that: (i) any balance is past due; and/or (ii) the

authorized but not yet posted) exceeds the Account’s credit limit or prepaid
balance (as applicable).&nbsp; Company shall, immediately upon request, pay the
excess amount and any associated fees or the entire balance due on the Account.

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">2.5. Company is responsible for
notifying Issuer of any revocation of any Account User’s authority to use or
access its Accounts, Cards or, as applicable, DINs and Company shall remain
liable for any charges made by an Account User until notice of revocation of

applicable DIN is deemed authorized use of the Account.&nbsp; Company assumes all
risk if Company chooses to leave a Card at a merchant for use by its drivers or
Account Users and as such, agrees to pay for all charges made with that Card.&nbsp;
Company agrees to keep DINs confidential and to provide for its employees or

Controls be applied to its Account(s).&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">3.1. The availability and
effectiveness of Controls is dependent upon each merchant’s adoption of card
specifications and the information, including product codes that the merchant
transmits to Issuer.&nbsp; The product codes are assigned by each merchant and not
Issuer.&nbsp; In addition, some Controls are not enforceable at island card readers
due to equipment restrictions at the merchant location.&nbsp; Only transactions
submitted for authorization are subject to Controls and those Controls can only
be enforced when the merchant provides sufficient information as part of the
authorization request.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">3.2. Default Control values are
only assigned by Company online.&nbsp; Company should review any additional
information related to Controls that is provided.&nbsp; Issuer is not responsible
for the prudence of any particular Control level selected by Company.&nbsp; Issuer
shall use reasonable efforts to deny requests for Transaction authorizations
that fall outside the selected Control parameters.&nbsp; Company remains responsible
for payment in full of Transactions which fall outside of the Control
parameters selected, if such Transactions are made with a valid Card and are
processed by Issuer.&nbsp; The existence and/or use of Controls will not affect
Company’s liability for Unauthorized Transactions in certain circumstances and

<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><span style="color:black">PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION OF
THE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">19.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section
provides that disputes may be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration
replaces the right to go to court, have a jury trial or initiate or participate
in a class action. In arbitration, disputes are resolved by an arbitrator, not
a judge or jury. Arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than in
court. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
(“FAA”), and shall be interpreted in the broadest way the law will allow.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">19.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Covered Claims</u>.
(a) Company or Issuer may arbitrate any claim, dispute or controversy between
Company and Issuer arising out of or related to this Account, any previous
related Account, the relationship between Company and Issuer, or any other
product or service provided by or through Issuer (called “Claims”). In this
Arbitration provision, the term “Issuer” includes any of Issuer’s affiliates
that provide or are involved in providing any products or services to Company
and the term “Company” includes any Guarantor. Claims include disputes relating
to incentives or benefits relating to the Account. A Person who asserts a
Claim, or against whom a Claim may be asserted, that is subject to this
Arbitration provision may be referred to as a “Covered Person.” (b) If arbitration
is chosen by a Covered Person, then no Covered Person will have the right to
litigate that Claim in court or have a jury trial on that Claim. (c) Except as
stated below, all Claims are subject to arbitration, no matter the legal theory
on which they are based on or the remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory
relief) they seek, including Claims based on contract, tort (including
intentional tort), fraud, agency, any Person’s negligence, statutory or
regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as
counterclaims, cross-claims, third-party claims, interpleaders or otherwise;
Claims made regarding past, present or future conduct; and Claims made
independently or with other Claims. This also includes Claims made by or
against any Person connected with Company or Issuer, or by a Person making a
Claim through Company or Issuer, such as an Account User, employee, agent,
representative or an affiliated/parent/subsidiary company.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">19.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Arbitration
Limits</u>. (a) Individual Claims filed in a small claims court are not subject
to arbitration, as long as the matter stays in small claims court. (b) Claims
brought as part of a class action, private attorney general or other
representative action can be arbitrated only on an individual basis. The arbitrator
has no authority to arbitrate any claim on a class or representative basis and
may award relief only on an individual basis. If arbitration is chosen by any
Covered Person, the Covered Person asserting the Claim may not pursue the Claim
as part of a class action or other representative action. Claims of two (2) or
more Persons may not be combined in the same arbitration. However, applicants,
Account Users on a single Account and/or related Accounts or corporate
affiliates are considered as one Person for these purposes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">19.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>How Arbitration
Works</u>. (a) Arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) according to this arbitration provision and the applicable
AAA arbitration rules in effect when the claim is filed (“AAA Rules”), except
where those rules conflict with this arbitration provision. The AAA Rules may
be obtained at the AAA’s website (www.adr.org) or by calling 800-778-7879. A
Covered Person may choose to have a hearing, appear at any hearing by phone or
other electronic means, and/or be represented by counsel. Any in-person hearing
will be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to Company’s
billing address. (b) If the AAA is not available to conduct the arbitration,
then a Covered Person may petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to
designate an appropriate arbitrator. (c) Arbitration may be requested at any
time, even where there is a pending lawsuit, unless a trial has begun or a
final judgment entered. A Covered Person does not waive the right to arbitrate
by filing or serving a complaint, answer, counterclaim, motion or discovery in
a court lawsuit. To choose arbitration, a Covered Person may file a motion to
compel arbitration in a pending matter and/or commence arbitration by submitting
the required AAA forms and requisite filing fees to the AAA. (d) The
arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator in accord with this
arbitration provision and the AAA Rules, which may limit discovery. The
arbitrator shall not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure for
discovery, but the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law
and shall take reasonable steps to protect Account information and other
confidential information of a Covered Person if requested to do so. The
arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and
applicable statute of limitations, and may award damages or other relief under
applicable law. (e) The arbitrator shall make any award in writing and, if
requested by a Covered Person, shall provide a brief statement of the reasons
for the award. An arbitration award shall decide the rights and obligations
only of the Persons named in the arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on
any other Person or dispute. </span></p>

to a Person based on applicable law.</span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="color:black">19.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>The Final Award</u>.
(a) Any award by an arbitrator is final unless a Covered Person appeals it in

arbitration appeal shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. The
panel will consider all facts and legal issues anew based on the same evidence
presented in the prior arbitration, and will make decisions based on a majority
vote. Arbitration fees for the arbitration appeal shall be allocated according
to the applicable AAA Rules. An award by a panel on appeal is final. A final
award is subject to judicial review as provided by applicable law. (b) A final
award may be entered in any court of appropriate jurisdiction.</span></p>

to be to “WEX Canada, Ltd.”, and the services to be provided by Issuer
hereunder will be provided by WEX Canada, Ltd. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:.5pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">26.2. Notwithstanding Section 2.1.2 above, no fee will
apply whenever Issuer agrees to a temporary over-limit credit override (but the
decision of whether or not to issue a temporary over-limit credit remains
entirely in Issuer’s discretion).</span></p>

any references in the Agreement to “federal” law will be understood to include
the federal law of Canada and any references therein to “state” law will be

acceptance within the WEX North American Fleet (“NAF”) network of retail
merchant locations. Because NAF transactions occur at NAF retail/forecourt
locations, certain product specific limit controls and transaction information
prompts may not be supported for NAF transactions. Further, due to system
differences, NAF transactions may not post in real time. By selecting a card
type with NAF network acceptance, Company acknowledges the foregoing and
accepts responsibility for any transactions that fall outside Control
parameters or lack standard information prompts that are not available on NAF
network transactions.&nbsp; Certain transaction fees set forth herein may also not
apply to NAF transactions.</span></p>
